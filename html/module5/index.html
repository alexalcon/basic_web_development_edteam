            there are two types of images:

                1. vector images: they are defined using mathematical equations
                   they can be scaled to any size without losing quality
                   common vector image formats are: .svg, .eps, .pdf
                   they are used for logos, icons, and simple graphics
                2. bitmap images: they are defined using a grid of pixels
                   they can lose quality when scaled
                   common bitmap image formats are: .jpg, .png, .gif, .bmp, .tiff
                   they are used for photographs and complex images

        <!-- 
            image formats:

                svg: Scalable Vector Graphics
                     vector image format (for the web)
                     best for logos, icons, and simple graphics
                     supports interactivity and animation

                jpg/jpeg: Joint Photographic Experts Group
                          bitmap image format (for the web)
                          best for photographs and complex images
                          supports millions of colors
                          uses lossy compression to reduce file size

                png: Portable Network Graphics
                     bitmap image format (for the web)
                     best for images with transparency and sharp edges

                gif: Graphics Interchange Format
                     bitmap image format (for the web)
                     best for simple animations and low-color images
                     supports transparency but limited to 256 colors

                webp: Web Picture format
                      bitmap image format (for the web; modern highly recommended)
                      developed by Google
                      provides superior compression and quality compared to jpg and png
                      supports transparency and animation

                avif: AV1 Image File Format
                      bitmap image format (for the web)
                      developed by the Alliance for Open Media
                      provides high compression efficiency and quality
                      supports transparency and animation

                heif: High Efficiency Image File Format
                      bitmap image format (not used much on the web)
                      used mainly in Apple devices
                      provides high compression efficiency and quality
